Background & Problem: The transportation industry faces challenges in effectively monitoring vehicle performance, leading to inefficiencies and safety risks. Real-time data visualization is often underutilized, missing opportunities for improvement.

SDGs Addressed: SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure) and SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities)

Personal Initiative: Recognizing the importance of user-friendly design in data-driven solutions, I took the initiative to create an intuitive frontend for a Telematics Dashboard that leverages real-time information for better decision-making and safety.

Societal Impact: My design work on the Telematics Dashboard provides a visually appealing and interactive platform for monitoring vehicle metrics in real-time. This frontend design enhances the usability and effectiveness of the tool, contributing to safer roads and more efficient transportation systems, ultimately making a positive impact on society.
